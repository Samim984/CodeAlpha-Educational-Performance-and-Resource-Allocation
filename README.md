# CodeAlpha-Educational-Performance-Dashboard  

# 🎓 Educational Performance & Resource Allocation – Power BI  

This project was developed as part of my **CodeAlpha Internship (Power BI Domain)**.  
The objective was to build an **interactive Educational Performance & Resource Allocation Dashboard**, covering:  

✅ **Student Performance** – Pass %, Fail %, Avg Marks, Subject/Class/District breakdown  
✅ **Teacher Allocation** – Teacher-Student Ratio, Experience, Salary Spend, Allocation Gap Analysis  
✅ **Finance & Planning** – Fees vs Budget, Scholarships, Forecasting & Variance Analysis  
✅ **Executive Overview** – Snapshot of Students, Teachers, Geography, and KPIs
